# NASM
A collection of some assembly projects. The following programs are required:
- QEMU
- NASM

64-bit Windows is also recommended and needed to run some projects, such as HelloNASM. Other projects, like Alphabet_Alternator, also use the QEMU emulator and runs just fine as long as the above programs are installed and in your path. For all of these programs, you should simply have to run the .bat file and it should do everything for you.
